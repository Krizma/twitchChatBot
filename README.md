# twitchChatBot
This is a twitch chat "bot" that I made in Auto Hot Key (https://autohotkey.com/). Essentially what it does is opens a twitch chat window (in this case it pulls up a friends twitch chat) hits tab twice then pulls 1 of 25 possible inputs from a hard coded array puts it in chat and sends it, waits 9.5 minutes then repeats. The idea of this is to keep my max level on Mikuia bot on that channel. 

How to use:
1.) Double Click the script
2.) Press F11+F12 at the same time.
3.) Leave Idling 

You can modify the script to work how you want and change what the chat says in the array. If you add to the array make sure you update the second number in the line  "Random, rand, 0, 24 ;RNG Between 0-24"
